## The team web app


## Project finished

This project  use react and firebase. It's a soccer web page that will include few routes like home, matches, schedule, players. In adition, the web will contain a login page to enter in the dashboard, change the team and make modifications...

In future updates i'll change firebase to MVC pattern because this way allows me to hide firebase api credentials and finally upload all to a server.
